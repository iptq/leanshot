# Modified version of build-release.sh
# Original comments left below.
#
# Usage: ./build-release <PROJECT> ${TRAVIS_TAG}-${TRAVIS_OS_NAME}
#
# The latest version of this script is available at
# https://github.com/emk/rust-musl-builder/blob/master/examples/build-release
#
# Called by `.travis.yml` to build release binaries.  We use
# ekidd/rust-musl-builder to make the Linux binaries so that we can run
# them unchanged on any distro, including tiny distros like Alpine (which
# is heavily used for Docker containers).  Other platforms get regular
# binaries, which will generally be dynamically linked against libc.
#
# If you have a platform which supports static linking of libc, and this
# would be generally useful, please feel free to submit patches.
